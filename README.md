# HumanePasswordGenerator
A website and php class to generate easy to remember and SAFE passwords.

It generates password from a word list, concatenating them with random special characters between them and some digits at the end.

To use H.P.G., just: 

    require( 'hpg.php' );
    
in your php file, and then call the class as such:

    $password = new HPG();
    echo $password->generate('words.sqlite', 2, 1);
    
Where words.sqlite is a database with a table named "words" and a single column named "word". 
The two digits are for length (number of words used) and complexity (either less/equal or bigger than 1, randomizes upper/lower/proper case words aswell as each special character.

The project has a [public website](https://algures.pt/projects/hpg/) and you can fetch your own passwords [here](https://algures.pt/projects/hpg/generator.php). 

It's based on XKCD's comic [936 "Password Strength"](https://xkcd.com/936/) with some changes to make passwords compliant with most websites security demands.

The word list used is the [“English Open Word List”](https://diginoodles.com/projects/eowl) (EOWL), developed by Ken Loge and is almost entirely derived from the “UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary” (UKACD) Version 1.6, by J Ross Beresford.
